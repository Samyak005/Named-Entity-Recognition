# Named Entity Recognition

I used Keras API with TensorFlow as its backend to build and train a bidirectional LSTM neural network model
to recognize named entities in text data. Named entity recognition models can be used to identify mentions of people, 
locations, organizations, etc. Named entity recognition is not only a tool for information extraction, 
but it also a preprocessing step for many NLP applications like machine translation, question answering, 
and text summarization.

Tagged entities:\
geo = Geographical Entity\
org = Organization\
per = Person\
gpe = Geopolitical Entity\
tim = Time indicator\
art = Artifact\
eve = Event\
nat = Natural Phenomenon
